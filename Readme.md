# Project Title

<h2 align="center"> Image Caption Generator </h2>

## Description

<p> Image caption generation is a procedure of identifying the context of an image and commentating it with the most
pertinent captions using deep learning, and computer vision. It involves the epithet of an image with English keywords
with the support of datasets which is provided during model training. We use a deep Convolutional Neural Network to
generate a vectorized representation of an image that we then feed into a Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network,
which then generates captions. LSTM ( Long short-term memory )is also one of the Recurrent neural network (RNN)
construct, mainly used in the deep learning discipline. The vivid applications of Image captioning are, natural language
processing applications, recommendations in editing applications, helpful for virtual assistants, for indexing the image,
for the blind or partially-sighted persons, for internet community etc.
